How to run the SampleDefense:
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Need to run two nodes, so need two terminal windows.  Nodes are
started in this directory with:

  ./run-mgmt-node.sh
  ./run-t1-node.sh

You should start the 'mgmt' node first, and delay a few seconds from
starting the 't1' node.  This only matters as far as what port the
internal web server will grab.  If you start them in the other order,
then some of the subsequent instructions might not be exactly correct
for your setup.

Depending on the speed of your machine, you will ned to wait until all
agents (there are 5) are discoverd and all their threats
evaluated. This will take at least 30 seconds or so.  

Look for the TestAgent2 and TestAgent initial belief state
computations and also the subsequent "Handled threat change" from the
ModelManager. After this, you can proceed.

All interaction happens with the SampleDefense servlet. Navigate your
web browser to:

  http://localhost:8800

then go to "Agents at the root" and then to "TestAgent".  If you
started the nodes in thge recommended order, 'TestAgent' will not show
up until everthing acquieces.  FInally, navigate to the
'SampleDefense' servlet link.  Here you wil do a 4 step process:

Step 1:  Setting the values offered

  In the "Sample Action" section, under the "Possible Values", use the
  CTRL or SHIFT key, ands select all the values (quarantine and
  release). Then click the "Set Values Offered" button.

Step 2: Injecting a diagnosis

  In the "Sample Diagnosis" section, select a sensor reading (choose
  compromised initially) and then click the "Set Sensor Value" button.
  You should see a belief state calculation from believability after
  this.

Step 3: Starting the action

  After some relatively short period of time, the diagnosis injected
  will cause the "Permitted Values" to be updated (with quarantine
  initially).  Selected that value and click the "Start" button.

Step 4: Stopping the action

  You need to wait some period of time for the action to start, but
  you also cannot wait too long before stopping the action (90 seconds
  and it will timeout I think).  After some time, select the
  completion code ("COMPLETED" initially) and click the "Stop" button.
  This should cause an action induce belief state calculation to
  occur.
