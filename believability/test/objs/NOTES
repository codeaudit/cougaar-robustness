Some useful command lines for running and viewing files:

Running the two nodes with unique, ordered names:

  ./run-mgmt-node.sh
  ./run-t1-node.sh

You will need to wait a while before doing anything after these two
commands.  There is a discovery propogration delay in the Cougaar
system that (for some reason) takes on the order of tens of seconds.

After all the test agents have been discovered (you'll see initial
belief state calculation for each) you can then start poking the
system with:

  ./inject-asset-objs.sh 
  ./inject-diagnosis.pl 

The first is a one-time thing that somehow "primes" the system by
creating the appropriate diagnosis and action objects.

The second can be used repeatedly as it injects diagnoses into the
system.

Notes on running the actions servlet:

  o wait for acquience and all agents known.  (Each should generate an
    initial belief state due to the initial diagnosis triggering its
    calculation).

  o In SampleDefenseServlet: set offered actions to Quarantine & Release 

  o In SampleDefenseServlet, observe that Quarantine & Release
    appear as offered values in "SampleAction".

  o If Quarantine does not become permitted, then issue a diagnosis or
    two of "Compromised" from the Diagnosis Servlet fpor the sample
    sensor (inappropriately named SampleDiagnosis).

  o In SampleDefenseServlet selected the permitted Quarantine value,
    and click "start".

  o In ActionMonitoringServlet, verify that the action's value changes
    to Quarantine and that it is no longer permitted.

  o After waiting a little while (I waited 30 seconds) us ethe
    DefenseServlet to declare Quarantine COMPLETED

  o in the ActionMonitoringServlet, see this confirmed in the servlet.
