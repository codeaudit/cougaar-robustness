<br>
To add MsgLog to a society:  
<blockquote>Transformation rule<br>
  </blockquote>
   
<blockquote>      
  <blockquote>At the moment, the rule to add msglog to  a society must be
modified to be run concurrently on more than one society at the TIC, as all
societies at the TIC share the same set of email servers.</blockquote>
       
  <blockquote>The current MsgLog rule is at <b>csmart/config/rules/robustness/uc2/msglog.rule</b>
in the msglog overlay. &nbsp;It is set up to run on socC. &nbsp;<br>
    <br>
To run it on another society, change the range of <b>mailusers</b> on different
societies (e.g. <b>socA</b>, <b>socB</b>, <b>socC</b>). &nbsp;At present,
there are <b>45</b> users defined on each of the<b> five</b> mail server
(on <b>sa007</b>, <b>sb007</b>, <b>sc007</b>, <b>sv007</b>, and <b>sv008</b>)
and less than <b>15</b> nodes per enclave.&nbsp; I normally assign users
    <b>1-15</b> to <b>socA</b>, <b>16-30</b> to <b>socB</b>, and <b>31-45</b>
to <b>socC</b>.&nbsp; If more nodes are added, more users will have to be
defined, and these ranges will have to change.<br>
    <br>
The rule uses the <b>smtp</b> facet from <b>$CIP/operator/s*-hosts.xml</b>
to identify the available mail servers. &nbsp;The following entries (in bold)
should be added to that file if they are not present already: &nbsp; There
must be at least the same number of mail servers defined as enclaves or email
can't be used and UC2 won't work. &nbsp;Also, delete the smtp facet from
any other host (it might be present on the file server (e.g. <b>sc007-utb</b>);
delete it from that host so that email isn't sent over the UTB).<tt><br>
   </tt>
    <blockquote><tt><b>&lt;host name='sa007'&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&nbsp; &lt;facet service="smtp"/&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b> &lt;/host&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;host name='sb007'&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;facet service="smtp"/&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b> &lt;/host&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;host name='sc007'&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&nbsp; &lt;facet service="smtp"/&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;/host&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;host name='sv007'&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&nbsp; &lt;facet service="smtp"/&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;/host&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;host name='sv008'&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&nbsp; &lt;facet service="smtp"/&gt;</b></tt><br>
      <tt><b>&lt;/host&gt;</b></tt></blockquote>
    <b>msglog.rule</b> uses the <b>smtp</b> facet (see above) and the <b>enclave</b>
facet (from <b>$CIP/operator/1ad-layout-10_4_1.xml)</b> to allocate one email
server per enclave and assign one inbox and one outbox for each node of the
following form:<br>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>-Dorg.cougaar.message.protocol.email.inboxes.<b>NCA-NODE</b>=pop3://node<b>5</b>:passwd@<b>sa007</b>:110</tt></li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><tt>-Dorg.cougaar.message.protocol.email.outboxes.<b>NCA-NODE</b>=smtp://node<b>5</b>:passwd@<b>sa007</b>:25</tt></li>
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>          
    <ul>
                   
    </ul>
                        Mail servers are assigned to the enclaves in order<b>. 
        </b>&nbsp;If the enclaves represent physical networks, the mail server 
physically located in an enclave should be assigned to that enclave. &nbsp;This
may necessitate reordering the smtp hosts in <b>s*-hosts.xml</b>.<br>
    <br>
We have installed         <b>Apache James 2.1.2</b> (<a
 href="http://james.apache.org">http://james.apache.org )</a> on <b>sa007</b>, 
        <b>sb007</b>, <b>sc007, sv007</b>, and <b>sv008</b>. &nbsp;This version
of MsgLog has only been tested with this version of Apache James.<br>
    <br>
James is supposed to be started when the server reboots, but I've noticed
it not running at times. &nbsp;To check if James is running on a machine,
    <b>ssh</b> to the machine and execute the following:<br>
    <blockquote><b>ps -efw | grep james</b><br>
    </blockquote>
If its not there, login as <b>root</b>, and start it as follows:<br>
    <blockquote><b>/var/OBJS/james-2.1.1/bin/run.sh &amp;</b><br>
    </blockquote>
If Apache James needs to be set up on another machine, some configuration 
is required, and I have not documented it. &nbsp;Contact         <a
 href="mailto:ford@objs.com">ford@objs.com</a> for help.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>Also, this rule sets link selection <b>policy</b>,<b> </b>MTS
    <b>aspects</b>, and link <b>protocols</b>, which will override any previous
settings:             
    <ul>
                
      <ul>
               
      </ul>
        
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><b>policy</b> specifies the LinkSelectionPolicy to be used. &nbsp;MsgLog
 requires <b>org.cougaar.core.mts.AdaptiveLinkSelectionPolicy</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
        
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><b>aspects</b> specifies the MTS Aspects to be loaded. &nbsp;Note
 that MsgLog's Aspects are<b> order-dependent</b>. &nbsp;MsgLog aspects should 
 be loaded in the order that they appear in the msglog rules. At this point, 
 it is not known how MsgLog interacts with the aspects of other use cases, 
 except for the <b>HeartbeatPiggybackerAspect</b>, which is used in AR-UC1,
 and should be loaded after other MsgLog aspects. &nbsp;Because this rule
specifies the ordered list of aspects via a java property, it will replace
any pre-existing aspect list in the society to which the rule is applied.
So, if there are Aspects or Protocols necessary to support other Use Cases,
they should be added to the definitions of <b>aspects</b> in the msglog rule
(and removed from other rules). &nbsp;While aspects can be loaded as components
instead of properties, I have trouble verifying which have been loaded in
what order when loaded that way, so I prefer this method.</li>
    </ul>
  </blockquote>
  <ul>
        
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
      <li><b>protocols</b> specifies the MTS Link Protocols to be loaded.
 &nbsp;Note that protocols are<b> not order-dependent</b>. &nbsp;For AR-UC2,
 we load the <b>LoopbackLinkProtocol</b>, <b>RMILinkProtocol</b>, and <b>OutgoingEmailLinkProtocol</b>
 &amp; <b>IncomingEmailLinkProtocol</b>. &nbsp;For AS-UC3, we also load <b>SSLRMILinkProtocol</b>.
 &nbsp;Cougaar messaging performance and robustness is improved if&nbsp;
        <b>OutgoingSocketLinkProtocol          </b>&amp;<b> IncomingSocketLinkProtocol</b>
and <b>OutgoingUDPLinkProtocol          </b>&amp; are loaded, but AR-UC2's
 reaction time is slowed down with these additional protocols also loaded
in the current implementation, as they all outperform email, so we are not
loading them at present. &nbsp;A future release will address this problem.
(<b>Note:</b> &nbsp;the Socket and UDP link protocols do not yet support
in-band WhitePages access, so do not use them yet). &nbsp; As with      
  <b>aspects</b>, our rule specifies <b>protocols</b> via a java property,
 which will replace any pre-existing aspect list in the society to which
the  rule is applied. So, if there are Protocols necessary to support other
Use  Cases, they should be added to the definitions of <b>protocols</b> in
the  msglog rule (and removed from other rules).  &nbsp;While protocols can
be loaded as components instead of properties without  any ordering issues,
its still easier to verify which have been loaded when  loaded with this
method.</li>
    </ul>
Also, <b>user.home</b> is required to be set to some readable directory  to
avoid a security exception when JavaMail tries to read <b>.mailcap</b>.<br>
    <br>
MsgLog is primarily self-tuning, but still has tons of tuning parameters
represented by java properties, some of which may need to be tweaked at some
point, esp. those related to detecting disconnected NICs. At present, we
only set the following:</blockquote>
  <ul>
                               
    <ul>
          <li><tt>-Dorg.cougaar.message.protocol.email.incoming.socketTimeout=20000</tt>&nbsp;
 This was required to keep CONUS pop3 connections from timing out receiving
 very large (5MB+) email messages from TRANSCOM agents. &nbsp;It was timing
 out at the default of 10000ms.</li>
               
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <blockquote>
    <ul>
           
    </ul>
    </blockquote>
  <blockquote></blockquote>
 </blockquote>
 To run the Rolling Partition Experiment:<br>
 
<blockquote>Actions and States<br>
       
  <blockquote>For the AR-UC2 Rolling Partition Experiment, we use four ACME
 Actions. &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
  We use <b>DisableNetworkInterfaces</b> and <b>EnableNetworkInterfaces</b>,
 to disable and enable the default interface (eth0) alternately on a pair
of Cougaar Nodes on the running society. &nbsp;These two actions are part
of ACME and are defined in <b>csmart/acme_scripting/src/lib/ultralog/stressors.rb</b>.
 &nbsp;Both of these actions take an argument, the name of the Cougaar Node
 whose host's default interface should be disabled/enabled.<br>
      <br>
  We also provide an action to monitor MsgLog's response, <b>MonitorProtocolSelection</b>,
 defined in <b>csmart/config/lib/robustness/uc2/msglog.rb, </b>to detect
and  display the data string from the Cougaar Event that we emit when we
switch  protocols. &nbsp;It looks like:<br>
           
    <blockquote><b>Switch from org.cougaar.core.mts.RMILinkProtocol to org.cougaar.core.mts.OutgoingEmailProtocol
 for messages from FWD-B to FWD-C</b><br>
      </blockquote>
  The action takes two arguments, the name of the destination node (<b>FWD-C</b>
 above) and new protocol to be used for messages to that node <b>(org.cougaar.core.mts.OutgoingEmailProtocol</b>
 above). &nbsp;With such arguments, Events will be printed when any node
switches  from any protocol to <b>Email</b> for messages to <b>FWD-C</b>.
&nbsp;If the protocol argument is omitted or nil, all protocol switches for
messages to the destination node will be printed. &nbsp;If the first argument
is nil,  protocol switches for messages to any node will be printed. &nbsp;If
both  arguments are omitted or nil, all protocol switches will be printed,
regardless  of destination or protocol.<br>
    <br>
We define the action <b>FlushMail</b> in <b>csmart/config/lib/robustness/uc2/flushmail.rb</b>.
&nbsp;This action is generally called after <b>ConnectOperatorService</b>
in a run script to clear all old messages from prior runs from inboxes. &nbsp;If
this is not called, MsgLog will read and discard the old messages at startup,
but this is a waste of resources. &nbsp;This action<br>
depends on the script <b>operator/flushmail.csh</b> which also is loaded
from the msglog overlay. &nbsp;As it runs as root, you might have to change
its file permissions for it to work properly:<br>
    <blockquote><b>chmod +x $CIP/operator/flushmail.csh<br>
      </b></blockquote>
      We also define an ACME State in <b>csmart/config/lib/robustness/uc2/msglog.rb</b>,
 &nbsp;<b>SwitchProtocols, </b>which can be used to <b>wait_for</b> a protocol
 switch after disabling or enabling an interface. &nbsp;It takes three arguments,
 node, protocol, and timeout. &nbsp;The first two are as described above.
&nbsp;The third defaults to 1 minute, at which point the wait is over and
the run can be ended or continued. &nbsp;We haven't found <b>SwitchProtocols</b>
as useful as <b>MonitorProtocolSelection</b>, as Events are not emitted if
no switch is made, and no switch is necessary when an interface is disabled
if Email is already in use, which it may be the case for several reasons.
&nbsp;It may still be using Email because of an earlier disconnect. &nbsp;It
may be trying out Email to see how it performs, which is done periodically
to calculate comparative performance metrics. Or it may be using Email because
a previous message send failed, or ack was late, or performed poorly, on
another protocol, though not necessarily as the result of disabling an interface.
    <br>
    </blockquote>
  Run Script<br>
       
  <blockquote><b>csmart/config/scripts/robustness/uc2/RunUC2.rb</b> is a
sample run script for the Rolling Partition Experiment on socC with AR-UC1
(Sledgehammer) active but not killing any nodes. &nbsp;Its a copy of the
default run script with the addition of the actions described above. &nbsp;To
run AR-UC2 without AR-UC1 loaded, just delete the lines flagged (*) below.
    <br>
    <br>
This line is added to locate the msglog actions:<br>
    <blockquote><b>$:.unshift File.join(CIP, 'csmart', 'config', 'lib')<br>
      </b></blockquote>
This line is added so that the transform can iterate over the enclaves.
    <blockquote><b>require 'ultralog/enclaves'</b><br>
    </blockquote>
*Add this line to load UC1's actions (delete it if not running with UC1's
defense active):<br>
    <blockquote><b>require 'robustness/uc1/aruc1_actions_and_states'<br>
      </b></blockquote>
Add these lines to load the actions:<br>
    <blockquote><b>require 'robustness/uc2/msglog'<br>
require 'robustness/uc2/flushmail'<br>
      </b></blockquote>
*This line applies UC1's transformation rule (delete it if not running with
UC1's defense active):<br>
    <blockquote><b>"#{RULES}/robustness/uc1",</b></blockquote>
And this one applies MsgLog's rule:<br>
  </blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote><b>"#{RULES}/robustness/uc2/msglog.rule"</b><br>
    </blockquote>
This line was added to delete all old messages from the inboxes.<br>
    <blockquote><b>do_action "FlushMail"</b><br>
    </blockquote>
Once <b>PublishNextStage</b> has been done, we:<b><br>
      </b>          
    <blockquote><tt><b>do_action "MonitorProtocolSelection", "FWD-B", "org.cougaar.core.mts.email.OutgoingEmailLinkProtocol"<br>
  do_action "MonitorProtocolSelection", "FWD-C", "org.cougaar.core.mts.email.OutgoingEmailLinkProtocol"</b></tt><br>
      </blockquote>
  &nbsp;This starts monitoring for switched to <b>Email</b> for messages
to      <b>FWD-B</b> and <b>FWD-C</b>.<br>
      <br>
  We then alternately disable FWD-B's interface, wait 20 seconds, disable 
FWD-C's interface, enable FWD-B's interface, wait 20 seconds, disable FWD-B's 
interface, enable FWD-C's interface, wait 20 seconds, and continue the cycle, 
so           
    <blockquote><b><tt>do_action "DisableNetworkInterfaces", "FWD-B"<br>
  do_action "GenericAction" do |run|<br>
  &nbsp; sleep 20.seconds<br>
  end<br>
  do_action "DisableNetworkInterfaces", "FWD-C"<br>
  do_action "EnableNetworkInterfaces", &nbsp;"FWD-B"<br>
  do_action "GenericAction" do |run|<br>
  &nbsp; sleep 20.seconds<br>
  end<br>
  do_action "DisableNetworkInterfaces", "FWD-B"<br>
  do_action "EnableNetworkInterfaces", &nbsp;"FWD-C"<br>
  do_action "GenericAction" do |run|</tt></b><tt><b><br>
  &nbsp; sleep 20.seconds</b><br>
        <b>end</b><br>
        <b>do_action "DisableNetworkInterfaces", "FWD-C"</b><br>
        <b>do_action "EnableNetworkInterfaces", &nbsp;"FWD-B"</b><br>
        <b>do_action "GenericAction" do |run|</b><br>
        <b>&nbsp; sleep 20.seconds</b><br>
        <b>end</b></tt><br>
      </blockquote>
  The objective here is to not have FWD-B and FWD-C connected to the network
 at the same time, so that their only means of communications between each
 other is via intermediaries, the Email server(s). &nbsp;<br>
      <br>
  Be careful not to leave an interface disabled when ending the cycle or
ending  the experiment. &nbsp;Cougaar will not complete normally without
being able  to communicate with a node at least occasionally, and the next
run will not  start properly with an interface disabled. &nbsp;To enable
both interfaces,  do the following:<br>
           
    <blockquote>&nbsp;<b>do_action "EnableNetworkInterfaces", "FWD-B", "FWD-C"</b><br>
      </blockquote>
    </blockquote>
       
  <blockquote>Placement of the stresses after<b> <b>PublishNextStage</b></b>,
setting  the sleep at 20 seconds, and the choice of nodes to disconnect,
can be varied.  &nbsp;These choices were made because there are a lot of
messages sent right  after&nbsp;<b>PublishNextStage</b>, the rollover to
Email should be able to occur  in 20 seconds, and I guessed correctly that
these two nodes in the same enclave  might send each other messages. &nbsp;The
same behavior should be observed  at other points during a run, but, obviously,
if no messages are being transported,  no protocol switch will occur. &nbsp;There
is a lower bound on the amount  of time required to switch protocols. &nbsp;It
should vary from a couple of seconds to ten or so, depending on the performance
and load of nodes and servers and network, and on MsgLog's tuning. &nbsp;By
default, for instance, nodes check their inbox for email every 5 seconds.
&nbsp;There is also a much fuzzier upper bound. &nbsp;If nodes are disconnected
for too long, the logistics application might fall back to predictors, which
will affect the result. Or, other defenses might kick in. &nbsp;AR-UC1, for
instance, might conclude that the node is dead and restart all its agents
elsewhere. &nbsp;This is a case for Deconfliction, coming in the next release.<br>
    <br>
The script <b>csmart/config/scripts/robustness/uc2/RunUC1.rb</b> runs AR-UC1
(Sledgehammer) with MsgLog loaded and active, killing a node but not disconnecting
any. This is a compatibility test for MsgLog and AR-UC1.<br>
    <br>
At present, there are compatibility problems with Adaptive Security (debugging
is underway), and compatibility with AR-UC3 (DOS) has not been tested.<br>
