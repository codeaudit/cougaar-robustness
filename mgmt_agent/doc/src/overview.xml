    This document describes the setup and use of the <emphasis>Adaptive Robustness Agent
    Liveness Defense</emphasis> (a.k.a. AR-UC1 or simply "the sledgehammer
    defense").  This defense provides components for detecting and
    restarting dead agents.  The components may be deployed as a stand-alone
    defense or configured as part of an integrated suite of robustness defenses.  In the
    latter case a "Defense Coordinator" is used to mediate defense actions.
