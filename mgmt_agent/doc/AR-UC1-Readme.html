<h1>Adaptive Robustness Use Case 1 README</h1>
This readme file contains a brief overview and instructions for running the
ManagementAgent (use case 1) software developed for UltraLog by the Adaptive
Robustness Thread Defense Team.&nbsp; Use Case 1 (UC1) is defined as an abnormal
termination of one or more agents due to the failure of a computer or node.
The primary UC1 requirement for the Robustness ManagementAgent is the detection
of lost agents due to computer/node failures and the restart of the dead
agents on alternate nodes.<br>

<h2>AR-UC1 COMPONENT OVERVIEW</h2>
This section identifies the components (plugins and servlets) required for
UC1. There are 10 UC1 unique components.&nbsp; The first 8 are used by the
Management Agent.&nbsp; The other 2 are loaded in the agents to be monitored.<br>
<br>
<h3>Management Agent Components</h3>
<ol>
  <li><b>HealthMonitorPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin monitors the health status
of all agents that are a member of a specified restart community.&nbsp; The
health status is determined by the receipt of heartbeats that are generated
by each monitored agent.&nbsp; When heartbeats are late/missed a ping message
is sent to the agent to determine if the agent is still active.&nbsp; If
the ping fails or if the frequency of late heartbeats exceeds a specified
threshold the DecisionPlugin is notified.</li>
  <li><b>HeartbeatRequesterPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is&nbsp; part of
the Management Agent and interacts with the HeartbeatServerPlugin in the
monitored agents to initiate heartbeat generation when requested by the HealthMonitorPlugin.&nbsp;
This plugin also receives the heartbeats generated by the monitored agent
and reports conditions that fall out side of specified tolerances.</li>
  <li><b>PingRequesterPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is part of the Management
Agent and interacts with the PingServerPlugin in the monitored agents.&nbsp;
Ping requests are sent to the PingRequesterPlugin by the HealthMonitorPlugin
when heartbeats are missed.</li>
  <li><b>DecisionPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is responsible for analyzing
health anomalies detected by the HealthMonitorPlugin and initiating appropriate
corrective action.&nbsp; Currently the DecisionPlugin handles two situations.&nbsp;
The first is the UC1 condition where one or more monitored agents have been
determined to be dead and must be restarted.&nbsp; In the second situation
the monitored agent(s)are still alive but are operating in a stressed mode
due to a hardware/network problem or possibly some kind of denial of service
attack. The current version of the DecisionPlugin does not perform any diagnosis
or corrective action for UC 2/3.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li>When an agent has been determined to be non-responsive a restart
is initiated.&nbsp; An agent is characterized as non-responsive by the HealthMonitorPlugin
if heartbeats have ceased and active pings fail. &nbsp;In this situation
the DecisionPlugin will obtain the hostname of a suitable location to restart
the agent from the RestartLocatorPlugin. &nbsp;The Decision plugin will then
publish a request for AgentActionPlugin to start the dead agent on the selected
host.</li>
    <li>The other condition handled by the DecisonPlugin is the situation
where a monitored agent is still alive but its heartbeats are consistently
arriving late (or not at all).&nbsp; This condition represents the first
level determination of possible UC 2/3 scenario.&nbsp; Additionaly logic
may be required here in later versions to perform further analysis of available
sensor data to determine the specific condition.&nbsp; At present the DecisionPlugin
simply decreases a heartbeat sensitivity parameter used by the HealthMonitorPlugin.&nbsp;
Over time this has the effect of causing the HealthMonitorPlugin to ignore
late heartbeats.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<ol type="1" start="5">
  <li><b>RestartLocatorPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is responsible for selecting
a location for an agent restart.&nbsp; This plugin will select a node from
a set of candidate nodes.&nbsp; The selected node will be the node in the
candidate set that has the fewest number of assigned agents.&nbsp; The set
of candidate nodes can be explictly specified by one of three methods.</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol type="a">
    <li><i>Plugin argument:</i>&nbsp; Candidate restart nodes may be specified
via the "RestartNode=" argument to the RestartLocatorPlugin.&nbsp; If multiple
nodes are specified the names are separated by spaces.</li>
    <li><i>Community attributes:</i>&nbsp; The candidate restart nodes may
be specified as attributes to the robustness community.&nbsp; The attribute
ID is "RestartNode" and the value is the node name.&nbsp; Multiple attribute
id/value pairs are required if more than one candidate node will be specified.</li>
    <li><i>ParameterModifierServlet:</i>&nbsp; The set of candidate restart
nodes may be specified at run time.&nbsp; The ParameterModifierServlet may
be used to send an list of node names to the RestartLocatorPlugin.&nbsp;
The servlet may be launched from a browser using a URL similar to the following
where HOST, PORT and ROBUSTNESS_MANAGER is replaced with the appropriate
host name, port, and robustness manager agent name.</li>
  </ol>

    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<ol start="6">
  <li><b>VacatePlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is used to move all community
member agents off a specified host.&nbsp; In this situation the agents that
are moved are still active.&nbsp; This "vacate host" action may be in response
to a percieved threat or for administrative purposes.</li>
  <li><b>RobustnessServlet:</b>&nbsp; This servlet is used by the RobustnessUI
application to display information about Robustness communities.&nbsp; The
servlet obtains information from MangementAgent blackboards and the Name
Server on behalf of the RobustnessUI.</li>
  <li><b>ParameterModifierServlet:</b>&nbsp; This servlet is used to modify
the externally configurable parameters used by the various ManagementAgent
plugins.&nbsp; See section 5.C above for information on how to invoke this
servlet.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Monitored Agent Components</h3>
<ol start="9">
  <li><b>HeartbeatServerPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is loaded into agents
that will be monitored by the ManagementAgent.&nbsp; This plugin will periodically
send heartbeat messages to the ManagementAgent upon request.</li>
  <li><b>PingServerPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin provides a reliable method
for determining if an agent is alive.</li>
</ol>
<h2>SETUP<br>
</h2>
<a href="AR-UC1-Setup.html">Detailed setup instructions</a> are found in
the file <a href="AR-UC1-Setup.html">AR-UC1-Setup.html</a>.<br>
<br>

<h2>CHANGE LOG</h2>
 
<ol>
   <li>June 2002: &nbsp;Initial release used for intra-thread integration</li>
   <li>August 2002: &nbsp;2nd release. &nbsp;Used for initial inter-thread
integration</li>
   
  <ol type="a">
     <li>HealthMonitorPlugin no longer requires that the name of the community 
to be monitores be specified as an argument.&nbsp; The HealthMonitorPlugin
now automatically determines the community name by looking for a community
with the attribute "ComunityManager" with its name as an argument.</li>
     <li>RestartLocatorPlugin no longer requires that the name of restart 
hosts be specified as an argument.&nbsp; By default the RestartLocatorPlugin
will consider any community host/node as a potential restart location. Restart 
nodes may be explicitly identified via plugin arguments or attributes defined 
for the restart community.</li>
