<h1>Adaptive Robustness Use Case 1 README</h1>
This readme file contains a brief overview and instructions for running
the ManagementAgent (use case 1) software developed for UltraLog by the
Adaptive Robustness Thread Defense Team.&nbsp; Use Case 1 (UC1) is
defined as an abnormal termination of one or more agents due to the
failure of a computer or node. The primary UC1 requirement for the
Robustness ManagementAgent is the detection of lost agents due to
computer/node failures and the restart of the dead agents on alternate
nodes.<br>

<h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
The purpose of these AR-UC1 components is to maintain agent liveness
within a community.&nbsp; This is accomplished by the addition of a
health monitor plugin to each node to monitor the health of resident
agents. Sensors are also added to each agent and node in the monitored
community.&nbsp; Using the sensors and capabilities provided by the
node infrastructure the health monitor plugins are able to detect the
unexpected loss of an agent or node.&nbsp; When the loss is detected
the affected agents are automatically restarted on another community
node. &nbsp; <br>
<br>
The health monitor plugin maintains state information for each
monitored agent.&nbsp; The following table defines the agent states
used by the health monitor plugin.&nbsp; An agent is assigned the
INITIAL state when it intially joins a robustness community.&nbsp; This
state indicates that the agent is to be monitored but no health monitor
plugin has yet located the agent and started reporting its status to
health monitor peers.&nbsp; Once an agent has been found by a health
monitor plugin, heartbeats are activated&nbsp; The agent will then
transition to the ACTIVE state where passive monitoring is performed
using a heartbeat sensor.&nbsp; A heartbeat timeout will cause the
agent state to transition to the HEALTH_CHECK state where an active
probe of the agents status is performed.&nbsp; At present this active
probing consists of a ping performed by a ping sensor.&nbsp; If the
ping is successful the agent state is reset to ACTIVE, otherwise the
state transitions to DEAD.&nbsp; From the DEAD state agents are
automatically placed into RESTART state.&nbsp; When in the RESTART
state the health monitor plugin will attempt to restart the agent on
another community node.&nbsp; Candidate restart destinations are
priortized based on current agent count.&nbsp; The node with the fewest
number of agents will be the selected destination.&nbsp;&nbsp; If the
restart succeeds the agents state is set to INITIAL.&nbsp; A failed
restart will put the agent into the FAILED_RESTAT state.&nbsp; From
this state the agent is automatically placed into the HEALTH_CHECK
state which will eventually cause a restart to be retried at another
destination.<br>

<h2>AR-UC1 COMPONENTS</h2>
This section identifies the components (plugins and servlets) required
for UC1. <br>
<h3>Manager Components</h3>
The following components are required for each agent and node that will
perform the health monitoring function for a community.&nbsp; The
typical configuration will be to insert these components in each node
agent in the community and the communities designated manager agent.<br>
<ol start="1">
  <li><b>HealthMonitorPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin monitors the health
status of all agents that are a member of a specified restart
community.&nbsp; The health status is determined by the receipt of
heartbeats that are generated by each agent.&nbsp; When heartbeats are
late/missed a ping message is sent to the agent to determine if the
agent is still active.&nbsp; If the ping fails the agent is determined
to be dead.</li>
  <li><b>HeartbeatRequesterPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is&nbsp; part
of the Management Agent and interacts with the HeartbeatServerPlugin in
the monitored agents to initiate heartbeat generation when requested by
the HealthMonitorPlugin.&nbsp; This plugin also receives the heartbeats
generated by the monitored agent and reports conditions that fall out
side of specified tolerances.</li>
  <li><b>PingRequesterPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is part of the
Management Agent and interacts with the PingServerPlugin in the
monitored agents.&nbsp; Ping requests are sent to the
PingRequesterPlugin by the HealthMonitorPlugin when heartbeats are
missed.</li>
  <li><b>ARServlet:</b>&nbsp; This servlet is used to display status
information maintained by the health monitor plugins in the community. <br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Monitored Agent Components</h3>
These components are required for each agent in a community that will
be monitored for liveness.<br>
<ol start="1">
  <li><b>HeartbeatServerPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin is loaded into
agents that will be monitored by the ManagementAgent.&nbsp; This plugin
will periodically send heartbeat messages to the ManagementAgent upon
request.</li>
  <li><b>PingServerPlugin:</b>&nbsp; This plugin provides a reliable
method for determining if an agent is alive.</li>
</ol>
