<h1>Adaptive Robustness Use Case 1 (AR-UC1) Setup<br>
</h1>
             This document provides instructions for configuring a Cougaar
 society to  demonstrate/test Adaptive Robustness (AR) Use Case 1 (AR-UC1)
 components.   &nbsp;Use Case 1 involves the detection and restart of agents
 that have been  lost due to a computer or node failure. &nbsp;These instructions
 are based  on the use of a modified version of the SMALL-1AD-TRANS society
 that is distributed  with CSMART. &nbsp;With minor variation most of these
 instructions  are also  applicable to the setup of the the TINY and FULL
versions of the  standard  1AD societies.<br>
  <br>
   
<h2>REQUIRED SOFTWARE</h2>
           
<h3>a. &nbsp;Cougaar</h3>
      Cougaar version 9.4.1.2 or greater is required.<br>
           
<h3>b. &nbsp;Adaptive Robustness JAR files</h3>
      Obtain the JAR files for the following modules from the Ultralog CVS
 repository   and copy to the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/lib directory.<br>
   
<ol>
    <li>    Robustness/OBJS/Sensors</li>
    <li>    Robustness/MIC/Mgmt_Agent </li>
   
</ol>
           
<h3>c. &nbsp;AR Use Case 1 CSMART Recipes</h3>
      A number of CSMART recipes are used to configure the standard 1AD societies
   for AR-UC1 demonstration and testing. &nbsp;The recipes listed below can
  be obtained from the test/data/recipes directory in the Robustness/MIC/Mgmt_Agent
   module or overlay. &nbsp;These recipes should be imported into the CSMART
   database.<br>
      <br>
   
<ol>
    <li>    HeartbeatServerPlugin-export.sql</li>
    <li>    PingServerPlugin-export.sql</li>
    <li>    SensorDomain-export.sql</li>
    <li>    RobustnessManagementAgents-export.sql<br>
  </li>
   
</ol>
      In addition to the recipes listed above, the file "recipeQueries.q" 
in  the  test/data directory must be copied to the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/configs/common
   directory. &nbsp;This file contains a couple unique database queries that
   are used by the AR recipes.<br>
           
<h3>d. &nbsp;AR Use Case 1 CSMART Experiment</h3>
      The following CSMART experiment is provided in the test/data/experiments
   directory in the Robustness/MIC/Mgmt_Agent module. &nbsp;This experiment
  modifies the standard SMALL-1AD-TRANS experiment to define communities
and   agent allocations suitable for running AR-UC1 tests. &nbsp;This experiment
  should be imported into the CSMART database.<br>
   
<ul>
    <li>    SMALL-1AD-TRANS-AR-export<br>
  </li>
   
</ul>
      This experiment contains 58 agents in 4 robustness communities. &nbsp;The
   allocation of agents to communities is as follows:<br>

          </tr>
                       
  </tbody>      
</table>
      <br>
      Each community (enclave} has a management agent that is responsible 
for   monitoring the community members and restarting them as necessary. &nbsp;The
  management agent is given a name like "1AD-Enclave1-RobustnessManager". 
&nbsp;The  name must be unique and must end with the string "RobustnessManager".<br>
  <br>
           
<h2>2. &nbsp;QUICK CHECKOUT USING MiniTestConfig SOCIETY</h2>
An easy way to verify that all required components are properly installed/configured
is to run a simple test using the MiniTestConfig society. &nbsp;This section
describes the steps for running a one computer test using the MiniTestConfig
society started from provided .ini files. &nbsp;This test uses 5 console
windows on a single computer.<br>
<ol type="a">
  <li> Test Setup:</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
  <ol>
    <li>This test is executed using the ant build tool.&nbsp; If ant has
not been installed it can be obtained from the <a
 href="jakarta.apache.org">jakarta.apache.org</a> website. &nbsp; If the
test will be run from Windows-2000 or XP, ant version 1.5 or better should
be used as the combination of java 1.4 and windows-2000/XP does not work
correctly with earlier versions of ant.&nbsp; If Linux is used ant 1.4.x
is ok.&nbsp; This ant commands used in this example assume that the test
is being run from the packages root directory (this is the top-level directory
with the build.xml file).</li>
    <li>The environment COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH path must be defined and point
to a directory containing Cougaar 9.4.1 or later.</li>
    <li>The "lib" subdirectory directory must contain the following jar files.&nbsp;
These jar files may be obtained from the cvs.ultralog.net web site.&nbsp;
The Robustness_mic_mgmt_agent.jar may also be created using the ant "build"
target.<br>

received from agent 3ID.&nbsp; A ping will be sent by the ManagementAgent
to 3ID to confirm its status.&nbsp; At this point the DecisionPlugin will
obtain a restart destination from the RestartLocatorPlugin and will initiate
a restart of 3ID on the selected restart node.</li>
    <li>If all goes well agent 3ID should restart on the mininode1.&nbsp;

    </li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. &nbsp;MODIFYING EXPERIMENT CONFIGURATION</h2>
      Using the CSMART Experiment Builder tool update the SMALL-1AD-TRANS-AR-export
   experiment to reflect the local environment.<br>
  <br>
           
<h3>a. &nbsp;Allocate nodes to hosts<br>
      </h3>
     The SMALL-1AD-TRANS-AR-export experiment is currently configured to
run  23 nodes on 5 computers. &nbsp;Depending on the availability of local
resources    this step may simply involve the re-allocation of the existing
nodes to  5  computers in the local enviroment. &nbsp;While it is not normally
recommended    that more than 1 node be allocated to a host, this 5 computer
configuration    defines a number of relatively small nodes for each host.
&nbsp;This is  done  to mimic the agent-node allocation in the TICs FULL-1AD
society and  also to provide multiple nodes to kill for various UC1 test
scenarios. &nbsp;If   the computers to be used for the society are not capable
of running this  number of JVMs the agents in the FWD-X and REAR-X nodes
could be consolidated  into single ENCLAVE1 and ENCLAVE2 nodes. Similarily
the agents in the AIR-NODE,    CONUS-NODE, CONTRANS-NODE, SEA-NODE, THEATERTRANS-NODE,
and TRANSCOM-NODE    nodes could be combined to form a singe ENCLAVE4 node.
<br>
      <br>
           
<h3>b. &nbsp;Specify restart nodes</h3>
     Each robustness community in the SMALL-1AD-TRANS-AR-export experiment
 designates   a specific node for restarting dead agents. &nbsp;By default
 this node is   named something like "Enclave1-RestartNode". &nbsp;The designation
 of restart   nodes for a community is performed using a community level
attribute.  &nbsp;This   attribute is found by going to the "Community" tab
in the CSMART  Experiment   Builder tool. &nbsp;Select the appropriate community
from the  community list.  &nbsp;The community name will be something like
"1AD-Enclave1-COMM".<br>
           
<ol>
      <li><i>Changing the restart node</i> &nbsp;- &nbsp;To change the name 
 of the restart  node simply modify the ATTRIBUTE_VALUE associated with the 
 existing RestartNode  id.<br>
      </li>
       <li><i>Deleting the restart node</i> &nbsp;- &nbsp;To delete the restart 
  node right click on the existing attribute entry and select "delete" from 
  the pop-up menu. &nbsp;If a robustness community does not specify a &nbsp;restart
   node the Management Agent will consider any node currently used by a commuity
   member as a possible destination for a restarted agent.<br>
      </li>
       <li><i>Adding restart nodes</i> &nbsp;- &nbsp;The default experiment 
 specifies  1 restart node for each restart community. &nbsp;However, multiple 
 restrart  nodes may be designated. &nbsp;To add additional nodes right click 
 on the  community name from the community list pane and select "Add Attribute" 
 from  the pop-up menu. &nbsp;Then add "RestartNode" to the new ATTRIBUTE_ID 
 and  the name of the node to the ATTRIBUTE_VALUE field. &nbsp;When multiple 
 restart  nodes are specified the Management Agent will consider all of these 
 as possible  destinations for a restarted agent. &nbsp;The actual node selected 
 will be  the one with the fewest number of running agents</li>
         
</ol>
<br>
           
<h2>4. &nbsp;RUNNING THE SMALL-1AD TEST SOCIETY</h2>
Once the required software has been installed and configured the experiment
   can be executed using the CSMART Experiment Controller tool. &nbsp;Using
  the Experiment Controller run the experiment configured from step 2 above.
  &nbsp;Monitor the log messages from 4 management agent nodes (named 1AD-EnclaveX-RobustnessManager).
   &nbsp;As the society is starting each management agent will detect the
existence   of the community members that it is monitoring and will log an
INFO message   "Adding XXXX" where XXXX is the name of the agent to be monitored.
&nbsp;Periodically   each management agent will log a summary message indicating
the total number   of agents being monitored and the current state of each.
&nbsp;All agents   should transition to the NORMAL state within a few minutes
of startup. &nbsp;The   NORMAL state indicates that the management agent
was successful in starting   the monitored agents HeartbeatServer. &nbsp;At
this point individual nodes   can be killed via the Control-&gt;Kill menu
item in a nodes console window.   &nbsp;When a node is killed the management
agent will log various warning   and error messages indicating heartbeat
and ping failures. &nbsp;Eventually   the dead agents will be retarted on
a restart node. &nbsp;If the restart  is successful, a log message "Reacquired
XXXX" will be generated where XXXX  is the name of the agent that was restarted.<br>
  <br>
   
<h2>5. &nbsp;MODIFYING ROBUSTNESS PARAMETERS</h2>
  The AR-UC1 components support the capability to override default values 
and to define agent-specific values for the following parameters. &nbsp;The 
SMALL-1AD-AR-export experiment discussed above uses the default values listed 
in the table below. &nbsp;While these are reasonable values they have not 
been optimized for any particular configuration. &nbsp;<br>

  <br>
   
<h4>a. &nbsp;Overriding default values</h4>
  New default parameter values are specified as plugin arguments. &nbsp;For
 instance to change the heartbeat frequency for all agents to 2 minutes,
the  argument "hbFreq=120000" would be specified. &nbsp;When using .ini files
multiple arguments must be separated by commas. &nbsp;For instance:<br>
   
<pre>plugin=org.cougaar.tools.robustness.ma.HealthMonitorPlugin(hbFreq=120000,&nbsp;pingRetries=2)</pre>
  The restartNode parameter allows more than one restart node to be defined.
 &nbsp;If multiple nodes are defined the node names must be separated by
spaces.  &nbsp;In addition to specifying restart nodes as a plugin argument
to the  RestartLocatorPlugin, this parameter may also be defined using community-level
 attributes. &nbsp;Using the CSMART community editor add a RestartNode attribute
 for each node to be used as a restart destination. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
Most of the parameters defined in the table above may also be specified at
run time.&nbsp; The <i>ParameterModifierServlet</i> may be used to send changes
to the applicable plugin.&nbsp; The servlet is launched from a browser using 
a URL similar to the following where HOST, PORT and ROBUSTNESS_MANAGER is 
replaced with the appropriate host name, port, and robustness manager agent 
name<br>
<br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>http://HOST:PORT/$ROBUSTNESS_MANAGER/modifyParameters
  </pre>
</blockquote>
<h4>b. &nbsp;Specifying agent-specific values</h4>
  Agent-specific values are specified using entity-level attributes in the
 appropriate robustness community definition. &nbsp;Using the CSMART community
 editor locate the community and agent requiring a non-default parameter
value.  &nbsp;Add an attribute id (from the table above) and value for the
parameter  to be defined. &nbsp;For instance if an agent requires a longer
ping timeout  (e.g., 2 minutes) period the attribute value "pingTimeout"
would be created  with the value "120000". &nbsp;This value would override
the community-wide  default that was defined.<br>
 <br>
<br>
<h2>6. &nbsp;MANUALLY CONFIGURING A &nbsp;RESTART COMMUNITY</h2>
  Restart communities are defined in the configuration database.&nbsp; Community
definitions in the configuration database are used by the Community Service
to assign an agent to its initial communities during startup.&nbsp; Starting
with Cougaar 9.4 CSMART provides the capability to create/edit community
definitions.&nbsp; Community definitions may also be created in an XML text
file and imported into the database using a utility program. &nbsp;Community
definitions for the MiniTestConfig and 1AD societies are part of this package
and are found in file "test/configs/data/communities.xml". &nbsp;After editing
this XML file the modified configurations can be imported into the configuration
database by running the ant tool with the target "dbimport".&nbsp; This ant
target accepts 3 optional arguments that may be specified with the "-D" option.&nbsp;
Note that "experiment" and "assembly" are mutually exclusive.&nbsp; Only
one of these may be specified.&nbsp; The most common use of this utility
will be to import an experiment into CSMART and use the corresponding experiment
name in the dbimport invocation.<br>

<h4>Examples:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Import the community definitions in the file "communities.xml" and
associate with the community Assembly_Id used by experiment "tiny-1ad-trans-exprt".</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt; ant -Dexperiment=tiny-1ad-trans-exprt -Dfile=communities.xml dbimport</pre>
</blockquote>
<ul>
  <li>  Import the community definitions in the file "communities.xml" and
associate with the community Assembly_Id "COMM-DEFAULT_CONFIG".</li>

<blockquote>
  <pre>&gt; ant -Dassembly=COMM-DEFAULT_CONFIG -Dfile=communities.xml dbimport</pre>

<ul>
  <li>Associating the name of a robustness community with a ManagementAgent.
&nbsp;The ManagementAgent will monitor all members agents from a specified
community.&nbsp; The name of the community to be monitored is determined
by the ManagementAgent during startup.&nbsp; The ManagementAgent will look
for a community that has the attribute "CommunityManager" with the value
equal to its name.&nbsp; The community definition that defines the restart
community must define this attribute.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For example:<br>
  <br>
<blockquote>
  <pre>&lt;Community Name="Enclave1Robustness-COMM"&gt;<br>  &lt;Attribute ID="CommunityManager" Value="Enclave1RobustnessManager" /&gt;<br>  &lt;Attribute ID="CommunityType" Value="Robustness" /&gt;<br>&nbsp; &lt;Entity Name="Enclave1RobustnessManager"&gt;<br>    &lt;Attribute ID="EntityType" Value="Agent" /&gt;<br>    &lt;Attribute ID="Role" Value="HealthReportConsumer" /&gt;<br>    &lt;Attribute ID="Role" Value="ManagementAgent" /&gt;<br>  &lt;/Entity&gt;<br>  &lt;Entity Name="1-27-FABN" &gt;<br>    ...<br>  &lt;/Entity&gt;<br>&lt;/Community&gt;<br></pre>
