<h2>Purpose:</h2>
Demonstrate the ability of the Coordinator to select different
corrective actions based on which provides a greater benefit per a
high-level MAU specification.<br>
<pre><br></pre>
<h2>Use Case Overview</h2>
<ol>
</ol>
In UC #2a, the Coordinator is not choosing between two different
defenses' actions, but whether or not it is worth performing an action
offered by a single defense.&nbsp; In this case, the AgentCompromise
defense detects that an agent has been compromised (in this case the
compromise is forced via an acme action).&nbsp;&nbsp; AgentCompromise
defense can either be permitted to kill the compromised agent and cause
it to be restarted it from a&nbsp; persistent snapshot, or it can be
denied permission to do this, in which case the compromised agent
continues to run..&nbsp; <br>
<br>
The compromise may be either Moderate or Severe.&nbsp; A Moderate
compromise is one that will have undesirable results, but will not
interfere with the overall ability to complete a plan; an example would
be an agent that was being used to commit thefts, but was otherwise
behaving normally.&nbsp; A Severe compromise will undermine the ability
of the society to perform its mission.&nbsp; A Moderate compromise
loses half its MAU security value, bit only a small amount of its MAU
completeness value.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Two MAU policies are used: HighSecurityMau, which values security more
highly than usual, and HighCompletenessMau, which does the
opposite.&nbsp; Under HighSecurityMau, the negative MAU impact of
running with even a Moderately compromised agent is significant enough
that the Restart will be permitted.&nbsp; However, under the
HighCompletenessMau, the benefits that would be lost by having to
restart the agent and resynchronize with its neighbors outweighs the
loss in MAU security&nbsp; dimension, so AgentCompromise is not
permitted to restart the agent.<br>

<h3>Experiments</h3>
1) HighSecurityMau<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">T1 - Set HighSecurityMau policy via a
servllet<br>
T2 - Comprimise an agent moderately<br>
T3 - AgentCompromiseDiagnosis=Moderate<br>
T4 - Belief = {Compromise=Moderate:High certainty]<br>
T5 - Restat is permitted<br>
T6 - AgentCompromise defense invalidates bad persistent snapshots &amp;
kills the agent<br>
T7 - RestartDiagnosis=Dead (after a few minutes)<br>
T8 - Belief = [Liveness=Dead:High certainty]<br>
T9 - Restart defense is permitted to restat the agent, which it then
does<br>
<br>
</div>
2) HighCompletenessMau<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">T1 - Set HighCompletenessMau policy via
a servllet<br>
T2 - Comprimise an agent moderately<br>
T3 - AgentCompromiseDiagnosis=Moderate<br>
T4 - Belief = {Compromise=Moderate:High certainty] - but, a Restart has
<span style="font-style: italic;">negative</span> benefit because the
loss due to restarting outweighs the security advatage<br>
T5 - Retssrt is not permitted<br>
