<h2>Purpose:</h2>
Demonstrate the ability of the Coordinator to select different
combinations of compenastory actions in a resource constrained
environment based on which combination provides a greater benefit per a
high-level MAU specification.<br>
<pre><br></pre>
<h2>Use Case Overview</h2>
<ol>
</ol>
In UC #2b, the Coordinator is choosing some combination of compensatory
action variants for an asset (in this case an enclave).&nbsp; There are
two actions available: ThreatConAction (with variants HighSecurity and
LowSecurity), and CompressAction (with variants Compress, AutoCompress,
and NoCompress).&nbsp; The ThreatConAction affects the Security asset
dimension by providing defense against cyberthreats.&nbsp; The
CompressAction affects the Completeness dimension by trading
(generally) abundant CPU resources to improve the use of (generally)
less abundant bandwidth resources.<br>
<br>
In both ThreatConAction variants, the ThreatConAction is provided a
certain
amount of (CPU) resources to use as it sees fit based on its assessment
of the
security situation; HighSecurity provides greater security than
LowSecuirity, but at greater cost in resources. &nbsp; Compress causes
all messages to be compressed and is the most expensive, AutoCompress
allows the CompressAction to compress or not at its discretion and is
cheaper but less benficial, and NoCompress is free but provides no
Completion benefits.<br>
<br>
The ideal situation is to run at HighSecurity and Compress, as this
provides maximal benefits fro both Security &amp; Completeness
MAUs.&nbsp; But this can only be done if sufficient CPU resources are
avialable.&nbsp; This use case illustares tradeoffs that can be made
when this is not the case.<br>
<br>
When insufficient CPU resources are available, one or both of the
ThreatConAction and CompressAction must be moved to a lower cost
variant - CPU availablity is an absolute limit on what can be
accomplished.&nbsp; When such a tradeoff must be made, the following
factors are considered by the Coordinator:<br>
<ul>
  <li>available CPU resources, which serve as a limit on what can be
done (these are stipulated in the use case, as there was insufficient
time to incorporate actual measurements)<br>
  </li>
  <li>belief estimates of the ThreatConLevel based on a threat model
and a ThreatConLevelDiagnosis provided by the Security defense.&nbsp;
The greater the security threat, the greater the benefit of
HighSecurity setting.&nbsp; In the reverse case, if there is no
security threat (say when running on a physically secure subnetwork),
ThreatConActions provide no benefit at all.<br>
  </li>
  <li>available bandwidth resources (these are stipulated in the use
case, as there was insufficient time to incorporate actual
measurements).&nbsp; The benefit of compression is greater when
bandwidth drops.</li>
  <li>policy, in the form of the setting of relative MAU weights for
Security and Completeness.&nbsp; For the use case, three policies are
provided: HighSecurity, HighCompleteness, and Normal.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Expected benefits and costs are computed over a planning horizon as
usual.&nbsp; For this uase case, instead of a greddy selection
algorithm in which the action(s) with the highest benefit or highest
cost/benefit ratio are selected in order, a recursive selection has
been added that considers all possible combinations of actions on the
(enclave) asset and then picks the combination with the highest total
benefit that is affordable with available resources.&nbsp; This
succeeds when limited resources are avialable, whereas the greedy
selection frequently would box itself into a suboptimal solution
because some expensive, but beneficial variant was selected first,
thereby precluding some alternate combination of several "almost as
good" but cheaper variants.&nbsp; Ultimately, the recusrive selection
should be applied to all situations; at present, it is applied only to
enclaves, due to a desire to avoid perturbing already working use cases
at the end of the UltraLog program.<br>
<br>
Note:&nbsp; This use case is somewhat unstable because not all
requested bug fixes have been made and because there was insufficient
testing time due to the end of the UltraLog program.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Note:&nbsp; See the directory Coordinator/modifications (README) for a
list of fixes to other modules that must be made in order for acuc2b to
work.<br>

</div>
<h3>Monitoring</h3>
To see these results, set the logging level for the Coordinator package
to INFO, and then:<br>
<ul>
  <li>tail -f SMALL-ROB-MGMT-NODE.log | grep -v DoNothing | grep -A1
Selected:</li>
</ul>
You can also see the "remaining resources"&nbsp; during the selection
process by:<br>
<ul>
  <li>tail -f SMALL-ROB-MGMT-NODE.log | grep -A5 "Available resources"<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Additional Tests</h3>
You can also set the AvailableBandwidth, MauPolicy, and OutsideLoad via
servlets associated with the enclave's manager agent.&nbsp; <br>
<br>
You can see the actions selected and their relative benefits as above.<br>
