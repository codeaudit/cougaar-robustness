<h2>Purpose:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Demonstrate that the Coordinator produces realistic believability
estimates of problem states given TechSpecs and real and artificial
sensor inputs. The believability must be visible and explainable.</li>
  <li>Demonstrate the ability to select reasonable actions from
available actions to correct believed problems. The reason for the
choice must be visible and explainable.</li>
  <li>Control real actuators.</li>
  <li>Select alternate actions if the initially chosen action is
ineffective</li>
  <li>Demonstrate that the selected actions are sensitive to high-level
poicy in the form of MAU settings<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<pre><br></pre>
<h2>Use Case Overview</h2>
<ol>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>UC#1 will deal only with selecting corrective (repair)
actions; it will not address either preventive actions or tradeoffs
between desirable actions in resource-limited situations.</li>
  <li>UC#2a also addresses corrective actions, but adds sensitivity to
adjustable MAU weights</li>
  <li>UC #2b controls compensatory defenses and chooses between them in
accordance with high-level MAU policy when resources are artificially
limited<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
</ol>
<h2>Coordinator Overview</h2>
<h3>Coordinator Operation</h3>
All society assets are modeled by a collection of orthogional "asset
dimensions".&nbsp; For example, an agent is described by its current
status w.r.t. the dimensions Liveness, Compromise, Connectedness, and
AbilityToCommunicate, among others.&nbsp; Additional dimensions can be
added by deifining additional TechSpecs.&nbsp; The dimensions for
different kinds of assets ovrelap, but need not be identical.&nbsp;
Different asset states have different values for the society; this is
expressed by assigning an MAU weight to each state.&nbsp; As with any
MAU weight, in UltraLog an MAU wight has three components:
completeness, security, and timeliness.&nbsp; For example, from a
completeness standpoint, an agent is far more valuable Live than Dead;
on the other hand, a Dead agent is quite secure, since it cannot be
compromised.<br>
<br>
"Events" resulting from "threats" (alternatively "stresses") can cause
an asset to spontaneously change state (generally, although not always
for the worse - for example , a communications problem may clear up
without any Cougaar intervention).&nbsp; Defense "actions" change the
state of an asset.&nbsp; A typical defense can change the state of an
asset in exactly one dimension, although this is not strictly a
requirement.&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>
<br>
Sensors make "diagnoses" about the current state of the various
assets.&nbsp; Diagnoses have varying degrees of accuracy, depending on
the kind of problem being monitored.&nbsp; Together with models of the
threats to which the assets are subject, the Coordiantor makes a
probabilistic estimate of the current state of&nbsp; the individual
assets.&nbsp; This "state estimation" is used to select defense actions
appropriate to the current believed state, society goals represneted by
MAU weights (i.e., is security, completeness, or timeliness most valued
at the present tiem), and avaiable resources.<br>
<h3>Defense Action Taxonomy:</h3>
Actions are categorized in 2 types. This matters because this
determines the relationship between state dimensions, actions, and
sensors, and determine the state dimensions to which benefit values are
assigned.:<br>
<ul>
  <li> CorrectiveActions - Restorative actions are those that fix a
problem that has occurred by restoring the system to a good state. They
are 1-time actions that change a state in the same state dimension as
some stress event. Benefits are determined over this single state
dimension. Sensors operate over this single dimension (with also the
possiblity of cross-diagnoses).</li>
  <br>
Example: Restart changes the state in the same dimension as does
NodeDeath event, moving an agent from Dead to Live whereas NodeDeath
moves the agent from Live to Dead.<br>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Compensatory Actions - Compensatory actions cannot fix a problem,
but can compensate for it by offering a workaround that presents the
assets with a better effective state than would otherwise be possible.
These are contiunuing actions that maintain the asset in a
"compensated" state
dimension separate from the "base" state dimension over which stress
events occur. <br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">Example: MsgLog <br>
</div>
<ul style="margin-left: 40px;">
  <li>Events (stresses) move us between states in a base
UnmediatedCommunicationsStatus dimension (with states like Normal,
StatioanryPartition, RollingPartition, etc.). There is nothing we can
do about our base state there other than
try to compensate for it if we don&#8217;t like it. <br>
  </li>
  <li>Actions place us into states in the MsgLog Settings dimension.
This we have complete control over. The purpose of being in a
particular state in this dimension is to ameliorate the consequences of
a bad state in the UnmediatedCommunicationsStatus dimension at
acceptable cost. The
amelioration may or may not succeed depending on what actual state is
in the Unmediated Comm Dimension (which we can only estimate).</li>
  <li>The society does not directly see or care about the
UnmediatedCommunicationStatus.&nbsp; What matters is the
MediatedCommunicationStatus, and it is to this the MAU weights are
assigned. (To make the caclutauons work out, the weights for base
dimensions are all 1.0, but this is just an artifact of the way the
TechSpecs are).<br>
  </li>
  <li>The combination of the base state in the UnmediatedCommunications
dimension and the MsgLog Setting will produice a result visible at the
society level.&nbsp; For example, if the actual base state is
RollingPartition and the MsgLogSetting is AllowIndirectProtocols (like
email), then the MediatedCommuniations statuis will be Degraded.&nbsp;
For the combination of StationaryPartition and AllowIndirectProtcols,
the MediatedCommunicationStatus will still be NotCommunicating.<br>
  </li>
  <li>Sensors over the Mediated Comm Dimension (per link) tells the
behavior of individual MsgLog link protocols (RMI, UDP, SMTP, etc.).
These sensors give measured behavior of what is actually observed to be
going on in MsgLog on each link protocol. These sensors are used by
Believability to make StateEsimations. But these sensors do not tell
how much value (benefit) an agent gets because MsgLog will use any
enabled links, so the behavior of a single link has little to do with
overall benefit.</li>
  <li>A single MsgLog sensor over the MediatedCommunicationsStatus
dimenion (overall)
tells the benefit to the agent. This is a function of timeToDeliver
messages compared to a baseline of desired behavior and classified into
one of several states (probably the same set of state values as used
for the link-specific sensors, although not necessarily).</li>
</ul>
