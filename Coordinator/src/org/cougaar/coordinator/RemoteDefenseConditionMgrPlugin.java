/**
 *
 *   UNUSED *******
 *
 *
 * This Plugin is used when the AdaptivityEngine (AE) is located in a different
 * agent. This plugin must be colocated with the Defense. It handles creating 
 * a surrogate object (relay) in the AE's agent blackboard so that values of 
 * the condition can be propagated to the AE.
 *
 * The plugin requires one argument (in the ini file), which is the name of the 
 * agent containing the AdaptivityEngine plugin. Do not instantiate this class
 * directly.
