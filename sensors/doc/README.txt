The Ping Sensor includes the following classes:

 PingRequestorPlugin - This plugin is installed in the agent that 
   will be requesting the ping (e.g. the Management Agent).

 PingServerPlugin - This plugin is installed in the agent that will 
   be responding to the Ping (e.g. the Monitored Agent).

 PingTesterPlugin - This is an example of how a user-defined plugin 
   (e.g. the HealthMonitorPlugin) would request a ping and receive
   and process the result.  It would be installed in the agent
   requesting the ping.  

 PingRequest - This is the object that the user plugin creates and
   publishes to its blackboard to request that a specific agent be
   pinged.

PingRequests are generated by the SensorFactory in the SensorDomain,
so the following line must be added to the requesting agent's .ini file.

  Node.AgentManager.Agent.DomainManager.Domain = org.cougaar.tools.robustness.sensors.SensorDomain(sensors)

There is a test config at test\configs\ping_test.  
See test\configs\ping_test\README.txt for more info.

javadocs are at doc\api\index.html

To compile & build sensors.jar, execute build.bat
To generate the javadocs, execute buildjavadocs.bat

This is a preliminary version of this software.  Dubug information is
printed to System.out.  This will be removed in the final version.
Please report any other violations of Cougaar standards to ford@objs.com.
