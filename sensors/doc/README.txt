The Ping Sensor includes the following classes:

 PingRequesterPlugin - This plugin is installed in the agent that 
   will be requesting the Ping (e.g. the Management Agent).

 PingServerPlugin - This plugin is installed in the agent that will 
   be responding to the Ping (e.g. the Monitored Agent).

 PingTesterPlugin - This is an example of how a user-defined plugin 
   (e.g. the HealthMonitorPlugin) would request a ping and receive
   and process the result.  It would be installed in the agent
   requesting the ping.  

 PingRequest - This is the object that the user plugin creates and
   publishes to its blackboard to request that a specific agent be
   pinged.

The Heartbeat Sensor includes the following classes:

 HeartbeatRequesterPlugin - This plugin is installed in the agent 
   that will be requesting that heartbeats be sent and receiving 
   reports of their status (e.g. the Management Agent).

 HeartbeatServerPlugin - This plugin is installed in the agents that will 
   be sending the Heartbeat (e.g. the Monitored Agent).

 HeartbeatTesterPlugin - This is an example of how a user-defined plugin 
   (e.g. the HealthMonitorPlugin) would request a Heartbeat and receive
   the result.  It should be installed in the agent requesting the Heartbeat.  

 HeartbeatRequest - This is the object that the user plugin creates and
   publishes to its blackboard to request that specific agents send
   Heartbeats.

 HeartbeatHealthReport - This is the object that the user plugin receives
   containing the status of the requested heartbeats.


The HeartbeatPiggybacker includes one java class: 

 HeartbeatPiggybacker - This class handles heartbeat filtering on each node,
   a piggybacking capability & delivery scheduler, and a destination node
   heartbeat filter that sends the HBs directly to the Metrics Service.

PingRequests and HeartbeatRequests are generated by the SensorFactory
in the SensorDomain.  The following line must be added to the requesting
agent's .ini file.

  Node.AgentManager.Agent.DomainManager.Domain = org.cougaar.tools.robustness.sensors.SensorDomain(sensors)

There are test configs at test\configs\ping_test and test\configs\heartbeat_test.  
See test\configs\ping_test\README.txt and test\configs\heartbeat_test\README.txt 
for more info.

javadocs are at doc\api\index.html

To compile & build sensors.jar, execute build.bat
To generate the javadocs, execute buildjavadocs.bat

This is a preliminary version of this software.

Caveats:
  - multiple targets are now supported in HeartbeatRequests, and 
    HeartbeatHealthReports report on them, but HeartbeatRequest.getStatus()
    hasn't been updated to reflect the status of multiple-target requests. 
  - haven't tested with ABA
  - heartbeats don't use UDP yet

Please report any problems to ford@objs.com.
